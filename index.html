        <h2>Kimano Lambert</h2>
        <p>I am Kimano Lambert, a 2nd year computer science student. I aspire to become a proficient data analyst/scientist one day, and to that end, I believe the ability to create webpages and applications is a step in the right direction. I registered for this course to challenge myself to learn new networking concepts and languages like JavaScript and PHP. I would also like to pass this course with flying colours.</p>
